### How can I personalize responses based on user data?
User metadata can be passed to the AI, allowing for personalized responses based on factors like login status, user type, or other relevant information from internal APIs.
### What is the process for escalating conversations to human agents?
Escalation occurs when the AI cannot adequately answer a question or when sensitive topics arise. We integrate with your existing ticketing systems (e.g., Zendesk, Salesforce, Slack) to create tickets or facilitate live chat seamlessly.
### How does the AI learn from our knowledge base?
We integrate with various data sources, including help centers, knowledge bases, and internal databases. The AI digests this information to answer future queries. We also leverage historical tickets and real-time API data to generate comprehensive responses.
### How do you handle data privacy and security?
We are SOC 2 Type 2 certified and GDPR compliant. We minimize PII storage and remove sensitive data from historical tickets.
### How can we improve the AI's performance over time?
Our admin portal allows for instant feedback and knowledge updates. It provides insights and tools to identify areas for improvement, ensuring continuous learning from new conversations and agent input.
### What metrics are available for monitoring AI performance?
We track industry-standard metrics for conversations, customer satisfaction, deflection, and resolution. Additionally, we offer AI-powered insights previously unavailable with traditional analytics.
### What features does the admin portal offer?
The admin portal serves as a central control console for monitoring metrics, analyzing conversations, and managing AI interactions. It provides a comprehensive interface for team collaboration and AI management.
### Can you assist our human agents in improving efficiency?
Yes, we offer agent-assist products that integrate with your existing ticketing platforms. These tools help agents access relevant information and draft suggested answers, improving efficiency and allowing focus on high-level tasks.
### What if we have limited engineering resources?
We are committed to handling any necessary engineering work to customize and implement the optimal solution for your team, regardless of your internal technical resources.
